# GUI GAME🕹️

Welcome to my first game!🎮


This C++ project is my freshman project, showcasing my early exploration into software development. It was my first time working with GUI ever using Windows Forms, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in building user-friendly interfaces. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.🌱

I'm proud of the progress I've made and the knowledge I've gained throughout this project. I'm eager to continue expanding my skills and exploring new avenues in software development.🙂

Feel free to explore the project, check out the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm open to collaboration and learning from fellow developers as I embark on this exciting development journey.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find value in exploring this project!
